/**
  * Created by Robert-PC on 9/21/2017.
  * The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex
  *           to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
  *  It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem,
  *           but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
