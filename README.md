# AdvancedAlgorithms
Implementation for some of the more interesting(subjective) algorithms.

Includes:
  - Fast Exponentiation
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path in a Graph
    - functional approach
    - imperative approach
  - Bellman-Ford's Algorithm for Shortest Path in a Graph with negative costs
  - Towers of Hanoi
    - Backtracking
    - A*
  - a mini-library that executes operations on Strings ( add, sub, mul, div, pow, etc ).
